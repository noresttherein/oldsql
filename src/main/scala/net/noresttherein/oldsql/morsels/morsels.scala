	/** Performs a weighted topological sort of `elems`. Consider a complete graph with edge weight
	  * defined by `precedence` function. Let the weight of a path in that graph be defined as the minimum edge weight
	  * on the path. This method sorts `elems` in such a way, that if `a` appears before `b`, then the maximum weight
	  * of all paths from `a` to `b` is not lesser than the maximum weight of all paths from `b` to `a`.
	  * Intuitively, weight of a path describes the difficulty of breaking it, and
	  * 'effective precedence' of `a` over `b` is the difficulty of completely disconnecting `a` from `b`.
	  *
	  * More formally,
	  *
	  * '''Contract'''
	  *
	  * let
	  *   1. `maxPrecedence == max(precedence(a, b))` for `a, b` in `elems`,
	  *   1. `powerSet` be the infinite (if `elems.nonEmpty`) set of all finite sequences `p` with elements from `elems`,
	  *   1. `weight(path :Seq[T])` be `min(precedence(path(i), path(j)) for 0 <= i <= j < path.length`,
	  *   1. `weight(a :T, b :T)` be `max(weight(a +: (p :+ b))) for p in powerSet`,
	  * Then the result is a permutation `p` of `elems` such that `weight(p(i), p(j)) >= weight(p(j), p(i))`
	  * for all `i <= j`.
	  *
	  * The implementation leverages the fact that regular topological sort is stable, i.e. doesn't change the order
	  * of any two elements if there is no path between them in either direction. It recursively performs topological
	  * sort of the input, specifying that an edge between `a` and `b` exists if `precedence(a, b) >= threshold`,
	  * for threshold taking increasing values from `1` to `maxThreshold`.
	  *
	  * Proof:
	  *
	  * '''Lemma''' For any `n >= 1`, let `p_n` be the permutation of `elems` after sorting with increasing
	  * thresholds `1..n`, and let `max(preceding(a, b)) <= n`. Then for all `0 <= i <= j < elems.length`,
	  * `weight(p_n(i), p_n(j)) >= weight(p_n(j), p_n(i))`.
	  *
	  * If the lemma is true, and `maxPrecedence` == `max(precedence(a, b))`, then the required post condition
	  * immediately follows.
	  *   1. When `n = 1`, the problem is reduced to an unweighted topological sort, and lemma is proved
	  *      by the correctness of DFS-based standard topological sort algorithm:
	  *      `weight(a, b) == 1` ''iff'' there is a path from `a` to `b`, so if `a` is sorted before `b`,
	  *      then existence of a path from `b` to `a` (`weight(b, a) == 1`) implies the existence of a path from
	  *      `a` to `b` (`weight(a, b) == 1`), proving the inequality.
	  *   1. Let us assume that the lemma holds for some `n >= 1` and that `max(precedence(a, b)) <= n + 1`.
	  *      Let `0 <= i <= j < elems.length, a == p_n+1(i), b == p_n+1(j)`. From the properties of topological sort,
	  *      existence of a path from `b` to `a`, consisting only of links of `precedence == n + 1`, implies
	  *      the existence of such a path from `a` to `b`, hence if `weight(b, a) == n + 1` then
	  *      `weight(a, b) >= weight(b, a)`. Let us then assume then that `weight(b, a) <= n`. Then, from the stability
	  *      of topological sort, `a` must appear before `b` in `p_n`, and we have `weight(a, b) >= weight(b, a)`
	  *      from ''lemma(n)''.
	  *
	  * @param elems         a sequence to sort.
	  * @param maxPrecedence the maximum value returned by `precedence` for any element pair from `elems`.
	  * @param precedence    a weight function defining the precedence of first argument over the second argument,
	  *                      taking values from `[0..maxPrecedence]` range.
