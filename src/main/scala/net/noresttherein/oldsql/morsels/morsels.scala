	/** Performs a weighted topological sort of `elems`. Consider a complete graph with edge weight
	  * defined by `precedence` function. Let the weight of a path in that graph be defined as the minimum edge weight
	  * on the path. This method sorts `elems` in such a way, that if `a` appears before `b`, then the maximum weight
	  * of all paths from `a` to `b` is not greater than the maximum weight of all paths from `b` to `a`.
	  * Intuitively, it is a topological sort of a graph in which an edge `a->b` exists if `precedence(a, b) >= 0`,
	  * which resolves cycle conflicts in favour of higher `precedence` values.
	  *
	  * More formally, let
	  *   - `powerSet` be the infinite (if `elems.nonEmpty`) set of all finite sequences with elements from `elems`;
	  *   - `weight(path :Seq[T])` be `min(precedence(path(i), path(j)) for 0 <= i <= j < path.length`;
	  *   - `weight(a :T, b :T)` be `max(weight(a +: (p :+ b))) for p in powerSet`
	  * Then the result is a permutation `p` of `elems` such that `weight(p(i), p(j)) <= weight(p(j), p(i))` for `i <= j`.
	  *
	  * The implementation leverages the fact that regular topological sort is stable, i.e. doesn't change the order
	  * of any two elements if there is no path between them in either direction. It recursively performs topological
	  * sort of the input, specifying that an edge between `a` and `b` exists if `precedence(a, b) >= threshold`,
	  * for threshold taking decreasing values from `maxPrecedence` to `1`.
	  * @param elems         a sequence to sort.
	  * @param maxPrecedence the maximum value returned by `precedence` for any element pair from `elems`.
	  * @param precedence    a weight function defining the precedence of first argument over the second argument,
	  *                      taking values from `[0..maxPrecedence]` range.
