/** In its basic use, a `FromClause` is a representation of the ''FROM'' and ''WHERE'' clauses in an SQL ''SELECT''
  * statement, declaring the relations taking part in a query. More generally, it is the domain over which SQL
  * expressions (instances of the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.SQLExpression SQLExpression]] class hierarchy)
  * are defined, providing all non-constant values available to them. It consists of a list of `Mapping`s,
  * together with an optional filter working on those mappings, especially any required join conditions.
  * While the individual elements of a clause are referred to often as tables for simplicity,
  * they can not only be arbitrary relations such as other ''selects'', but also synthetic artifacts
  * such as query parameters. It is even possible to use arbitrary mapping components, to be replaced at a later time
  * with references to concrete tables, parameters or constants. As such, it doesn't necessarily represent
  * a valid fragment of a select from the application's schema. In that case it's best thought as a signature containing
  * declarations of terms (mappings and parameters) over which SQL formulas can be defined;
  * hence `SQLExpression` is parameterized with a `FromClause`.
  *
  * The mappings taking part in the query are encoded in the static type of the standard implementation, which
  * builds both the instance and its type by recursively applying the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.AndFrom AndFrom]]
  * type and its subtypes to a shorter clause, extending it by another relation. In that aspect it is quite similar
  * to general purpose heterogeneous lists such as the ''shapeless'' `HList` and
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.collection.Chain Chain]], replacing its wide functionality with specific application
  * to this task. Just as a `HList` - and all other two-argument type constructors - it can be and is better written
  * using the infix notation: `Dual Join Rangers Join Familiars Join Monsters`. Note that the whole `Join`
  * class hierarchy is left-associative for more natural left to right reading and writing. Specialized classes for
  * all join kinds exist, as well as special variants for ''from'' clauses of subselects of some outer clause as well
  * as unbound query parameters. Other implementations, not derived from `AndFrom` are also possible, in particular
  * decorators extending [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.DecoratedFrom DecoratedFrom]] which introduce no new relations,
  * but can add other features. As subtypes are also universally covariant regarding their `FromClause` type parameters,
  * any prefix can be always substituted with the abstract `FromClause` supertype, balancing static type checking
  * with a degree of freedom and flexibility promoting code reuse. A `FromClause` subtype from the above category
  * is said to be ''complete'' if its definition starts with the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.Dual Dual]]
  * or [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.From From]] type, that is the number of all mappings participating
  * in the join/clause is known (although their types may be abstract). Note that the mapping types may
  * still be abstract and the joins may be some generic base type like `AndFrom`. The opposite is an ''incomplete''
  * clause, the definition of which starts with the base `FromClause` type or an abstract type `F &lt;: FromClause`:
  * `FromClause Join Deaths Join Instruments`, which specifies any sequence of relations ending with the `Deaths`
  * and `Instruments`.
  *
  * This trait is a bare bones common upper type, serving at the same time as a wildcard in type definitions meaning
  * 'an arbitrary number of other preceding relations not relevant in the circumstances at hand'. Most functionality
  * is defined in the `AndFrom` subclass representing actual non-empty clauses. Some additional generic methods however
  * are made available through implicit conversions in order to benefit from the static self type:
  *   - from any `F &lt;: FromClause`
  *     to [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.FromClauseExtension FromClauseExtension]], which declares
  *     some accessors, in particular
  *     `relations` to [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.JoinedRelations JoinedRelations]] and
  *     `entities` to [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.JoinedEntities JoinedEntities]], as well as
  *     `join` methods for appending new relations;
  *   - from non-empty clauses `F &lt;: FromSome`
  *     to [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.FromSomeExtension FromSomeExtension]], which define factory methods
  *     for other join types;
  *   - from clauses without a `Subselect` join `F &lt;: OuterFrom`
  *     to [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.OuterFromExtension OuterFromExtension]] for adding unbound
  *     query parameters in the form of the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.JoinParam JoinParam]] synthetic 'joins'.
  *
  * Aside from the above extensions, associated implicits and other helper classes, the companion object
  * defines some base types serving as common upper bounds and several useful type aliases which enforce
  * certain features on `FromClause` instances, such as [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.OuterFrom OuterFrom]],
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.SubselectFrom SubselectFrom]] and others.
  *

	/** Proof that the ''from'' clause `E` is an extension of the clause `F` / the clause `F` is a prefix
	  * of the clause of `E`. It means that `E &lt;: F AndFrom T1 ... AndFrom TN forSome { type T1 ... TN }`.
	  * This takes into account only the static type of both clauses and the actual mapping lists on both can
	  * differ and be of different lengths if `F` is not a complete clause and has an abstract prefix.
	  * For this reason this class should be in general relied upon only in the context of the actual extension,
	  * rather than a proof of `E` containing all the relations of `F` unless `F` is complete.
	  * A non-obvious implication of being contravariant in the extending type `E` is that if `F` is incomplete,
	  * this instance is also a witness that subtypes of `E` which replace the initial `FromClause` with a join list
	  * are likewise extensions of `F`, in this way covering both extensions from the back (right side) and front
	  * (left side). The purpose of this class is to allow `SQLExpression` instances based on one clause `F`
	  * to be converted into isomorphic expressions based on a second clause `E`, as long as all mappings
	  * in `F`'s static type form a continuous subsequence of mappings listed in `E`. Note that `SQLExpression`
	  * is contravariant in its clause type parameter, meaning that an abstract `FromClause` occurring
	  * at the start of the from clause type parameter doesn't 'hide' any mappings used by that expression,
	  * but to the contrary, serves to signify that it doesn't rely in any form on that portion of the clause
	  * it is based on. As a result, this proof is indeed a valid representation that such a conversion from `F` to `E`
	  * is possible for any `SQLExpression`. Due to this contravariance in `E`, this isn't any form
	  * of a generalized subtyping relation and should be relied upon only in the context of the actual extension.
