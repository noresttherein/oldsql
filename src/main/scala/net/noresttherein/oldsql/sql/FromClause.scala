/** In its basic use, a `FromClause` is a representation of the ''FROM'' and ''WHERE'' clauses in an SQL ''SELECT''
  * statement, declaring the relations taking part in a query. More generally, it is the domain over which SQL
  * expressions (instances of the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.SQLFormula SQLFormula]] class hierarchy) are defined,
  * providing all non-constant values available to them. It consists of a a list of `Mapping`s, together with an optional
  * filter working on those mappings, especially any required join conditions. While the individual elements of a clause
  * are referred to often as tables for simplicity, they can not only be arbitrary relations such as other ''selects'',
  * but also synthetic artifacts such as query parameters. It is even possible to use arbitrary mapping components,
  * to be replaced at a later time with references to concrete tables, parameters or constants. As such, it
  * doesn't necessarily represent a valid fragment of a select from the application's schema.
  * In that case it's best thought as a signature containing declarations of terms (mappings and parameters)
  * over which SQL formulas can be defined; hence `SQLFormula` is parameterized with a `FromClause`.
  *
  * The mappings taking part in the query are encoded in the static type of the standard implementation, which
  * builds both the instance and its type by recursively applying the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.With With]]
  * class to a shorter clause, extending it by another relation. In that aspect it is quite similar to general
  * purpose heterogeneous lists such as the ''shapeless'' `HList`, replacing its wide functionality with specific
  * application to this task. Just as a `HList` - and all other two-argument type constructors - it can be and is better
  * written using the infix notation: `Dual Join Rangers Join Familiars Join Monsters`. Specialized classes for
  * all join kinds exist. Note however that the whole `Join` class hierarchy is left-associative for more natural
  * left to right reading and writing. As they are also almost universally covariant regarding its left clause
  * type parameter, any prefix can be always substituted with the abstract `FromClause` supertype, balancing
  * static type checking with a degree of freedom and flexibility promoting code reuse. A `FromClause` subtype
  * from the above category is said to be ''complete'' if its definition starts
  * with the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.Dual Dual]] (or [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.From From]]) type,
  * that is all mapping types participating in the join/clause are known. The opposite is an ''incomplete'' clause,
  * the definition of which starts with the base `FromClause` type: `FromClause Join Deaths Join Instruments`,
  * which specifies any sequence of relations ending with the `Deaths` and `Instruments`. Note that this is not the same
  * as concrete/fully instantiated types, as a clause can contain abstract types as relation mappings
  * and still be complete.
  *
  * This trait is a bare bones common upper type, serving at the same time as a wildcard in type definitions meaning
  * 'an arbitrary number of other relations not relevant in the circumstances at hand'. Most functionality
  * is defined in the `With` subclass representing actual non-empty clauses. Additionally, an implicit conversion
  * exists from any `F &lt;: FromClause` to
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.FromClauseMethods FromClauseMethods[F] ]] which declares methods
  * for joining it with other relations and others which benefit from having a static, invariant self-type.
  * Individual relations can be most easily accessed through the
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.JoinedTables JoinedTables]]
  * and [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.JoinedRelations JoinedRelations]] classes exposed by the
  * `tables` and `formulas` methods defined by the implicit conversion.

	/** Proof that the ''from'' clause `S` is an extension of the clause `F` / the clause `F` is a prefix
	  * of the clause of `S`. It means that `S &lt;: F With T1 ... With TN forSome { type T1 ... TN }`.
	  * This takes into account only the static type of both clauses and the actual mapping lists on both can
	  * differ and be of different lengths if `F` is not a complete clause and has an abstract prefix.
	  * For this reason this class should be in general relied upon only in the context of the actual extension,
	  * rather than a proof of `S` containing all the relations of `F` unless `F` is complete.
	  * A non-obvious implication of being contravariant in the extending type `S` is that if `F` is incomplete,
	  * this instance is also a witness that subtypes of `S` which replace the initial `FromClause` with a join list
	  * are likewise extensions of `F`, in this way covering both extensions from the back (right side) and front
	  * (left side). The purpose of this class is to allow `SQLFormula` instances based on one clause `F` be converted
	  * into isomorphic expressions based on a second clause `S`, as long as all mappings in `F`'s static type
	  * form a continuous subsequence of mappings listed in `S`. Note that `SQLFormula` is contravariant in
	  * its clause type parameter, meaning that an abstract `FromClause` occurring at the start of the from clause
	  * type parameter doesn't 'hide' any mappings used by that formula, but to the contrary, serves to signify that
	  * it doesn't rely in any form on that portion of the clause it is based on. As a result, this proof
	  * is indeed a valid representation that such a conversion from `F` to `S` is possible for any `SQLFormula`.
	  * Due to this contravariance in `S`, this isn't any form of a generalized subtyping relation
	  * and should be relied upon only in the context of the actual extension.
