/** In its basic use, a `FromClause` is a representation of the ''FROM'' and ''WHERE'' clauses in an SQL ''SELECT''
  * statement, declaring the relations taking part in a query. More generally, it is the domain over which SQL
  * expressions (instances of the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.SQLExpression SQLExpression]] class hierarchy) are defined,
  * providing all non-constant values available to them. It consists of a a list of `Mapping`s, together with an optional
  * filter working on those mappings, especially any required join conditions. While the individual elements of a clause
  * are referred to often as tables for simplicity, they can not only be arbitrary relations such as other ''selects'',
  * but also synthetic artifacts such as query parameters. It is even possible to use arbitrary mapping components,
  * to be replaced at a later time with references to concrete tables, parameters or constants. As such, it
  * doesn't necessarily represent a valid fragment of a select from the application's schema.
  * In that case it's best thought as a signature containing declarations of terms (mappings and parameters)
  * over which SQL formulas can be defined; hence `SQLExpression` is parameterized with a `FromClause`.
  *
  * The mappings taking part in the query are encoded in the static type of the standard implementation, which
  * builds both the instance and its type by recursively applying the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.With With]]
  * class to a shorter clause, extending it by another relation. In that aspect it is quite similar to general
  * purpose heterogeneous lists such as the ''shapeless'' `HList`, replacing its wide functionality with specific
  * application to this task. Just as a `HList` - and all other two-argument type constructors - it can be and is better
  * written using the infix notation: `Dual Join Rangers Join Familiars Join Monsters`. Specialized classes for
  * all join kinds exist. Note however that the whole `Join` class hierarchy is left-associative for more natural
  * left to right reading and writing. As they are also almost universally covariant regarding its left clause
  * type parameter, any prefix can be always substituted with the abstract `FromClause` supertype, balancing
  * static type checking with a degree of freedom and flexibility promoting code reuse. A `FromClause` subtype
  * from the above category is said to be ''complete'' if its definition starts
  * with the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.Dual Dual]] (or [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.From From]]) type,
  * that is all mapping types participating in the join/clause are known. Note that the mapping types may
  * still be abstract and the joins may be some generic base type like `With`. The opposite is an ''incomplete'' clause,
  * the definition of which starts with the base `FromClause` type or an * abstract type `F &lt;: FromClause`:
  * `FromClause Join Deaths Join Instruments`, which specifies any sequence of relations ending with the `Deaths`
  * and `Instruments`.
  *
  * This trait is a bare bones common upper type, serving at the same time as a wildcard in type definitions meaning
  * 'an arbitrary number of other relations not relevant in the circumstances at hand'. Most functionality
  * is defined in the `With` subclass representing actual non-empty clauses. Additionally, an implicit conversion
  * exists from any `F &lt;: FromClause` to
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.FromClauseMethods FromClauseMethods[F] ]] which declares methods
  * for joining it with other relations and others which benefit from having a static, invariant self-type.
  * Individual relations can be most easily accessed through the
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.JoinedTables JoinedTables]]
  * and [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.sql.FromClause.JoinedRelations JoinedRelations]] classes exposed by the
  * `tables` and `formulas` methods defined by the implicit conversion.
