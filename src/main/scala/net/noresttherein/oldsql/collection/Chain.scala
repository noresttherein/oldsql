/** A list-like collection of fixed length, with the types of all its elements encoded in its type.
  * This is a very limited variant of ''shapeless'' `HList`, but which is extended from the end, rather than the front,
  * in opposition to traditional immutable lists. This stems from the intent of using it in conjunction with
  * `FromClause`, with `With` being likewise left-associative, which makes the elements of both appear in the exact same
  * order, rather than reversed as an ease-of-life feature.
  *
  * Chain instances are, like lists, typically built by extending the empty chain `@~`:
  * {{{
  *     val values = @~ ~ 1 ~ "next" ~ 4.2
  *     values :@~ ~ Int ~ String ~ Double
  * }}}
  *
  * Aside from the traditional empty and non-empty subclasses, there are also subtypes of `Chain` with specific type
  * bounds, making possible enforcing a desired invariant without resorting to implicit witnesses.
