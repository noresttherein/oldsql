/** A deep mapping proxy substituting the buffs of `backer` with the given collection.
  * All (sub)components of `backer` are similarly adapted, with all buffs inherited (and adapted) from `backer`
  * being replaced with a cascaded copy of `replacements`. This class makes some assumptions when identifying
  * the inherited buffs suffix to replace in subcomponents.
  *   1. The [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buffs.tag tag]] of `backer.buffs` is unique in the whole
  *      component tree;
  *   1. When adapting ('cascading') buffs from `backer` for subcomponents, `tag` of the inherited buffs is preserved;
  *   1. Some or all declarations from a mapping can be dropped by its (sub)component, but the order
  *      of inherited declarations is preserved: it two declarations with the same tags are both present
  *      on two components, then they are present in the same order. The declaration here means a complete
  *      `Buff` collection declared on a single mapping.
  *
  * All above conditions hold within default implementations; however, if buffs were reset by a subcomponent of `backer`
  * (and, in the result, inheriting no buffs from enclosing mappings by it or its components), the operation will
  * have no effect for that subcomponent subtree.
  *
  * The replacement buffs are cascaded for every component, but declarations which were not inherited by the component
  * are removed. Then, all buffs inherited by the component from `backer.buffs` are replaced with the new list.
  * Any hypothetical existing declarations in `component.buffs` which are located after a declaration inherited
  * from `backer.buffs` but are not themselves inherited, are also removed.
  * In this way, the new buffs of every mapping in the component tree of `backer` consist of three segments:
  *   1. old buffs of the mapping, without buffs inherited from `backer`,
  *   1. 'new' declarations in `replacements`: cascaded `replacements` with the longest suffix common with
  *      `backer.buffs` dropped,
  *   1. 'old' declarations in `replacements`: the suffix of `replacements` common with `backer.buffs`,
  *      with any declarations not present in the old buffs of the mapping removed.
  * This behaviour aims to combine the 'delta' buffs of all components with the 'delta' buffs of the replacements.
  * If `replacements` contains declarations from `backer.buffs` as a suffix, it is thus treated as 'delta' buffs
  * rather than flat out replacement, and those preserved buffs are cascaded to the new export subcomponents only
  * if they cascaded in the adapted mapping.
  * In particular, if none of the tags from `backer.buffs` are found in the `component.buffs` stack
  * (possible if some intermediate component declares no buffs at all, for example), then `replacements` are added on
  * the very bottom of the stack, after dropping the whole common suffix with `backer.buffs`.
