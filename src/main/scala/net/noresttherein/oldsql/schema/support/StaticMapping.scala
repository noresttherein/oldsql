	  * is not responsible for recognizing whether a value can be assembled, but rather this functionality is
	  * shared by `isDefined` method, which can force `map` to return `None` without calling `construct`,
	  * and catching later any `NoSuchElementException`s thrown from  this method and resulting from a failed assembly
	  * of a subcomponent. Another difference is that `pieces` is declared as an implicit parameter, which coupled
