	  * is not responsible for recognizing whether a value can be assembled, but rather this functionality is
	  * shared by `isDefined` method, which can force `assemble` to return `None` without calling `construct`,
	  * and catching later any `NoSuchElementException`s thrown from  this method and resulting from a failed assembly
	  * of a subcomponent. Another difference is that `pieces` is declared as an implicit parameter, which coupled
	  * with an implicit conversion of `TypedMapping[O, T]` to `T` in its presence, allows to use the components directly
	  * as arguments to the constructor of the returned subject instance. For example:
