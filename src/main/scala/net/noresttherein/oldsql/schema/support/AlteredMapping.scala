/** A factory for mapping adapters which modify buffs on chosen components and columns in order to affect
  * if they should be used in a particular database operation. All columns are by default both eligible and mandatory
  * for all database operations and, in order to exclude a particular one - both completely and only by default -
  * they require [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff Buff]]s being applied. The exact buffs affected by this factory
  * are defined in every [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType OperationType]] instance:
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.prohibited prohibited]] (for example,
  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.NoSelect NoSelect]]): completely disallows the use of a component
  *      in that operation type under any circumstances. Providing a component with this buff in the 'include' list
  *      will result in an `IllegalArgumentException`.
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.nonDefault nonDefault]] (such as
  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.NoSelectByDefault NoSelectByDefault]]): the buff which excludes
  *      the component from a particular operation type. All columns which do not carry this buff are included
  *      by default, and in most cases are impossible to use in this capacity without adapting the mapping first.
  *      It occurs typically in the form of [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.explicit explicit]] buff 
  *      ([[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.ExplicitSelect ExplicitSelect]]), which can be removed
  *      by this procedure, making the component selectable (or insertable, updatable, etc) normally.
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.optional optional]]: buffs such as 
  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.OptionalSelect OptionalSelect]] are the opposite of the `nonDefault`
  *      buffs: they mark components which can be omitted from the selected/updated column set. Listing a component
  *      without this buff in the 'excludes' argument will result in an `IllegalArgumentException`. At the same time,
  *      the buff provides a default value for the component which will be returned in place of the one
  *      in the table/entity object.
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.exclude exclude]]: instead of replacing an `OptionalXxx`
  *      with an `ExplicitXxx` to exclude a component, this synthetic buff implying `NoXxxByDefault` is added
  *      (unless the component already has a `NoXxxByDefault` attached) to force this change.
  * 
  * It is important to remember that buffs can be declared on any component, and that they cascade: the default
  * behaviour implemented by all bundled classes is for compatible buffs to be passed on to every subcomponent and
  * column of the buffed mapping. Such inherited buffs always follow the more deeply/directly defined buffs, and
  * may be shadowed by, or come to conflict with, a similar buff defined on a subcomponent. For example,
  * when having an `ExplicitSelect` buff both on a component and one of its columns, if that component is passed
  * in the 'include' list, the change described earlier will affect the whole component tree under it,
  * ''with the exception of'' that single column. In order for the column to be included in the column set,
  * it would have to be specified alongside its ancestor component, because its `ExplicitSelect` will remain
  * active. Similarly, an inherited added `exclude` buff is contradicted by an `optional` buff coming before it
  * (that is, defined somewhere under the component tree of the component which is excluded) and the buffed column
  * must be individually specified in the 'exclude' list to be omitted.
  * 
  * Another consequence of buff inheritance and performing the changes on the level of single components
  * (rather than manually for the whole tree) is that passing to be included a component which already is included
  * by default has no effect; in particular, any its columns which are not included by default are unaffected
  * (and will not be included). The same goes for excluding components. On the other hand, if a column or component
  * under one of the listed components has the `prohibited`/does not have the `optional` buff, it will be ignored
  * as previously, without raising an error. An exception is thrown only if current buffs of the explicitly
  * listed components do not allow the changes to be made.
  * 
  * It is important to note that this algorithm only simulates the effect that changing buffs on a component would
  * have on the buffs of its [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Mapping.export export]] subcomponents by a different 
  * process. Mapping implementations are allowed to handle buffs differently, ignore them or implement completely
  * custom behaviour, which can potentially interfere with how this factory operates. In particular, non-standard
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Mapping.optionally optionally]] methods can be bypassed.
  * 
  * Remember also that [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.extra OperationType.extra]] columns
  * (having o [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.ExtraSelect ExtraSelect]] buff or its sibling) imply
  * `prohibited` (`NoSelect`); despite taking part in every operation of the given type, they cannot appear
  * on the 'include' list, but rather are included automatically at a later stage.

/** A mapping proxy with `includes` and `excludes` lists of components of the `backer` mapping.

  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Mapping.buffs buffs]] in such a way that they are included/excluded
  * from all database operations where it is possible.
  * All components on the `included` list which do not carry
  * an `op.`[[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.prohibited prohibited]] buff for any operation
  * `op <: `[[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType OperationType]], have all
  * `op.`[[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.nonDefault nonDefault]] buffs removed.
  * This typically means removing `op.`[[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.explicit explicit]].
  * All components on the `excluded` list which carry an `op.`[[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.optional optional]],
  * but not an `op.`[[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationType.nonDefault nonDefault]],
  * (so, those which actually use [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.OptionalSelect OptionalSelect]],
  * rather than [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.ExplicitSelect ExplicitSelect]], for example),
  * receive a special `nonDefault` buff.  Other listed components are silently ignored.
  *
  * All components passed to public constructors (and public factory methods) are first substituted with their
  * ''export'' version for `mapping`.
  *
  * While this class overrides [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Mapping.apply(adjustments* apply]]`(adjustments)`
  * in order to combine the lists, with the selection type of the new argument always taking precedence over
  * the adjustments given as constructor arguments to this instance. This implementation is however very likely
  * to be overriden if a [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.support.MappingAdapter MappingAdapter]] is mixed in.
  * Two special late mix in traits however are provided with overrides of this method returning some `Mapping` subtype:
