/** A `Mapping` proxy which substitutes some components of the original, while retaining the others.
  * This is typically used for modifying the buffs on some of the components or columns, by substituting components
  * of `backer` with adapters in the form of [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.support.BuffedMapping BuffedMapping]]
  * or similar copies of columns for the same form. Most notably, it is used to alter the buffs defining
  * which columns should take part in which database operations, creating in the process a mapping which
  * ''by default'' includes/excludes certain columns which were excluded/included in the origin for the purpose
  * of a single operation type. The companion object contains factory methods which manipulate buffs controlling
  * the effective (default) column sets, the class itself isn't specific to that application and can be used
  * for other purposes by providing suitable `substitutions`.

/** A factory for mapping adapters which modify buffs on chosen components and columns in order to affect
  * if they should be used in a particular database operation. All columns are by default both eligible and mandatory
  * for all database operations and, in order to exclude a particular one - both completely and only by default -
  * they require [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff Buff]]s being applied. The exact buffs affected by this factory
  * are defined in every [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationView OperationType]] instance:
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationView.Prohibited Prohibited]] (for example,
  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.NoSelect NoSelect]]): completely disallows the use of a component
  *      in that operation type under any circumstances. Providing a component with this buff in the 'include' list
  *      will result in an `IllegalArgumentException`.
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationView.NonDefault NonDefault]] (such as
  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.NoSelectByDefault NoSelectByDefault]]): the buff which excludes
  *      the component from a particular operation type. All columns which do not carry this buff are included
  *      by default, and in most cases are impossible to use in this capacity without adapting the mapping first.
  *      It occurs typically in the form of [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationView.Explicit Explicit]] buff
  *      ([[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.ExplicitSelect ExplicitSelect]]), which can be removed
  *      by this procedure, making the component selectable (or insertable, updatable, etc) normally.
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationView.Optional Optional]]: buffs such as
  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.OptionalSelect OptionalSelect]] are the opposite of the `NonDefault`
  *      buffs: they mark components which can be omitted from the selected/updated column set. Listing a component
  *      without this buff in the 'excludes' argument will result in an `IllegalArgumentException`. At the same time,
  *      the buff provides a default value for the component which will be returned in place of the one
  *      in the table/entity object.
  *   1. [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationView.Exclude Exclude]]: instead of replacing an `OptionalXxx`
  *      with an `ExplicitXxx` to exclude a component, this synthetic buff implying `NoXxxByDefault` is added
  *      (unless the component already has a `NoXxxByDefault` attached) to force this change.
  *
  * It is important to remember that buffs can be declared on any component, and that they cascade: the default
  * behaviour implemented by all bundled classes is for compatible buffs to be passed on to every subcomponent and
  * column of the buffed mapping. Such inherited buffs always follow the more deeply/directly defined buffs, and
  * may be shadowed by, or come to conflict with, a similar buff defined on a subcomponent. For example,
  * when having an `ExplicitSelect` buff both on a component and one of its columns, if that component is passed
  * in the 'include' list, the change described earlier will affect the whole component tree under it,
  * ''with the exception of'' that single column. In order for the column to be included in the column set,
  * it would have to be specified alongside its ancestor component, because its `ExplicitSelect` will remain
  * active. Similarly, an inherited added `Exclude` buff is contradicted by an `Optional` buff coming before it
  * (that is, defined somewhere under the component tree of the component which is excluded) and the buffed column
  * must be individually specified in the 'Exclude' list to be omitted.
  *
  * Another consequence of buff inheritance and performing the changes on the level of single components
  * (rather than manually for the whole tree) is that passing to be included a component which already is included
  * by default has no effect; in particular, any its columns which are not included by default are unaffected
  * (and will not be included). The same goes for excluding components. On the other hand, if a column or component
  * under one of the listed components has the `Prohibited`/does not have the `Optional` buff, it will be ignored
  * as previously, without raising an error. An exception is thrown only if current buffs of the explicitly
  * listed components do not allow the changes to be made.
  *
  * It is important to note that this algorithm only simulates the effect that changing buffs on a component would
  * have on the buffs of its [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Mapping.export export]] subcomponents by a different
  * process. Mapping implementations are allowed to handle buffs differently, ignore them or implement completely
  * custom behaviour, which can potentially interfere with how this factory operates. In particular, non-standard
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Mapping.optionally optionally]] methods can be bypassed.
  *
  * Remember also that [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.OperationView.Preset OperationType.Preset]] columns
  * (having o [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.SelectPreset SelectPreset]] buff or its sibling) imply
  * `Prohibited` (`NoSelect`); despite taking part in every operation of the given type, they cannot appear
  * on the 'include' list, but rather are included automatically at a later stage.
