	  * Under normal circumstances (a single query, not joined with the referenced table) the references will
	  * be equivalent to those created with the [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.RelatedEntityFactory.absent absent]]
	  * method of the factory (or `nonexistent`, if this component is nullable). The implementation however

	  * values of the referenced table with matching keys are found, they will be lazily resolved using
	  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.RelatedEntityFactory.delay delay]] method of the factory.
	  * This delay loading doesn't require an open transaction when the values are accessed.
	  *
	  * This factory method can be adapted to work with optional keys on both sides, in any combination.
	  *   1. If both the foreign key and referenced key are not null, then the factory argument can
	  *      be converted with method [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.RelatedEntityFactory.required required]]
	  *      to enforce that there are no [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.RelatedEntityFactory.nonexistent nonexistent]]
	  *      references - that all instances of `R` carry either the value `T`, or the key `K`, or both.
	  *      This is optional, as - assuming the columns of the created mapping are indeed not null -
	  *      method `nonexistent` will not be called when assembling values from a `ResultSet`, as a key will always
	  *      be present.
	  *   1. The case where the foreign key is optional (the columns of this component are nullable),
	  *      but the referenced key type `K` is not an `Option[_]`, then everything proceeds as before,
	  *      except the factory should return a valid value from its `nonexistent` method. This can always be done
	  *      by returning `None` and having an `Option` as the reference type: `R <: Option[_]`. A non-optional
	  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.RelatedEntityFactory RelatedEntityFactory]] can be turned into
	  *      an optional one using method [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.RelatedEntityFactory.optional optional]],
	  *      if needed. Additionally, adding a [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Buff.SelectDefault SelectDefault]]
	  *      with `None` value will cover the case of `null` key.
	  *   1. If the referenced component is nullable and maps to a `K=:=Option[I]` then the key type used by the factory
	  *      must also be an `Option`; a factory of type `RelatedEntityFactory[K, E, T, R]` can always be adapted
	  *      to type `RelatedEntityFactory[Option[K], E, T, R]` using one of its
	  *      [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.RelatedEntityFactory.optionalKeys optionalKeys]] method.
	  *      This formally requires the factory to have a valid `nonexistent` value, but the method will never
	  *      be called if this component will always return `Some`. Additionally, the internal index on the referenced
	  *      component will be an optional one, ignoring `null` and `None` values when caching the results.
	  *   1. If both the foreign key and the referenced key are nullable and map to `Option[K]` (or a similar type),
