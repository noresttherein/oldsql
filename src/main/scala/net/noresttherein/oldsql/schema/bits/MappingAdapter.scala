/** A public interface of `Mapping` implementations based on some other, single mapping instance.
  * The original instance is exposed as a component of this mapping via the `body` property so that access to
  * the former's components is preserved. The adapted mapping and all its (sub)components are valid (sub)components
  * of this adapter. The contents of the `components`/`subcomponents` and individual column lists may vary, depending
  * on the adapter's function. Most often, unless it is this adapter's main purpose, its component and column lists
  * will consist exactly of the ''export'' versions of the corresponding list in the adapted mapping, but other schemes
  * are also possible, for example the `body` as the only direct component. The body's components might,
  * but do not have to, be ''export'' components of this mapping, as it is free to make any adjustments to them.
  * They have to however be recognized by the `apply` methods returning extracts and included in the `extracts` map.
  *
  * The type parameters of this trait and their bounds are the result of a need to cover various possible cases under
  * a common adapter type extending `TypedMapping` which is required by some classes rather than `RefinedMapping`.
  * For this reason the constraints are more lax than they ideally should be - in particular the mapping type `M`
  * should generally be of the same `Origin` type `O` as this adapter. Unfortunately, this in most cases results
  * in a duplication of the origin type in the type signature as a `M &lt;: MappingAt[_]` type bound results in
  * issues with type unification of the type parameter at the use site (see the
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.Mapping Mapping]] trait documentation for more information about this limitation).
  *
  * Client code should, if possible, use one of the type aliases defined in the companion object which propagate
  * some combination of the subject and origin types from the original mapping to the adapter.
  *
  * Most implementations will not extend this trait directly, but rather one of its subtypes:
  *   - [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.bits.MappingAdapter.DelegateAdapter DelegateAdapter]] for adapters
  *     implemented as a [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.support.DelegateMapping DelegateMapping]] to their `body`;
  *   - [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.schema.bits.MappingAdapter.ComposedAdapter ComposedAdapter]] for adapters
  *     of adapters or, more correctly, adapters implemented as a `DelegateMapping` to an adapter of their `body`.
  *
  * This trait overrides factory methods creating adapter mappings such as `map` so they return a `MappingAdapter`
  * to the same mapping type `M` as this mapping (rather than to this adapter as `StaticMapping`).
  *
