/** A value of type `T` or an identification of such a value. It is used as a reference to a database resource
  * or resources (typically entity/entities, but also individual components of an entity).  A kin can be either
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Present$ Present]] - contain a value or be able to compute it
  * without a significant cost and outside resources - or [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Absent$ Absent]],
  * in which case it should contain information required to locate and compute the given value. Absent kin can be either
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Missing$ Missing]] (if the value exists, in the logical sense - a corresponding
  * entity is expected to exist in the database) or [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Nonexistent$ Nonexistent]] -
  * if it is known to not exist. Nonexistent kin typically carry no 'key', but it need not always be the case.
  * It is possible that the information about the distinction is unavailable, and thus checking only for these two cases
  * can miss some absent kin. In particular, a special [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Unknown$ Unknown]] kin
  * is neither present nor does it contain any information about the value. It should be used sparingly
  * as most operations won't be able to do anything useful with it and may result in an error. However, if a member
  * of an updated entity, `Unknown` means unchanged - the relationship will not be updated.
  * Belonging to any of the above groups isn't determined by the class, but rather whether a value is present
  * and what additional information is known. This allows a single class to serve in all the above roles, depending
  * on given parameters, which is of particular importance for lazily evaluated instances.
  *
  * Independent of the above, an absent kin can, instead of some 'key'/specification of the referenced value, contain
  * one or more kin, the joint values of which comprise the referenced value. This allows adding a new element
  * to a collection without loading it to memory first. Additionally, ''many to many'' relationships implemented
  * with join tables can produce such kin if the rows of the join table are loaded, but not the related entities
  * referenced by their foreign keys. This allows kin to be 'partially loaded' - containing both absent and present kin
  * as their part. They are called ''collective'' kin and can be created and matched using
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Collective$ Collective]] object.
  *
  * All of the above statuses are defined in terms of appropriate polymorphic methods of this trait -
  * `isXxx` for status `Xxx` and not the actual implementation subclass. In particular, both present and absent
  * instances can be modeled using the same class, and the exact status may even be not known at creation time,
  * such as with [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Lazy$ lazy]] kin. The hidden specification of the referenced values
  * is however class/implementation dependent, and mapping components can typically handle directly only kin
  * constrained in a specific way (such as the mapped foreign key) and compatible implementation class.
  *
  * `Kin` are particularly useful to represent relationships between different database entities or
  * resources which can be otherwise expensive to compute and shouldn't be fetched by default - they shield model
  * classes from the implementation details about how those associations are implemented and resolved.
  * An instance thus might contain an associated, pre-fetched entity, or a foreign key to it.
  * They can be used for any type, including collections, and an absent `Kin` for a to-many relationship
  * can for example specify a reverse foreign key (foreign key on the target entity and the primary key on this entity).
  * They can also serve as actual search filters - queries are after all only a filter specification on a table.
  *
  * This trait, for reasons of clarity, uniformity and conciseness, specifies only the composite value type, providing
  * no information about the actual entity type from which it is derived. All operations which are dependent on
  * this element type in their definition require an implicit
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.ComposedOf.DecomposableTo DecomposableTo]] (or
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.ComposedOf ComposedOf ComposedOf]]), which might sometimes be inconvenient.
  * Similarly, an absent instance without any information about the composition type cannot be used to create
  * a present instance.  Whenever decomposition of the value type `T` is needed for a kin, it might be more practical
  * to use [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Derived Derived]]`[E, T]` subtype, which knows both how to derive
  * the value type `T` from the element/entity type `E`, and how to extract all element values from kin value
  * if present. In order to avoid the inconvenience of providing both type arguments (likely repeating type `E`
  * as part of type `T`), one of specific type aliases can be used:
  *   - [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.One One]]`[E]` is a kin for a single entity (a ''to-one'' relationship);
  *   - [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Supposed Supposed]]`[E]` is a kin for `Option[E]` (a ''to-zero-or-one''
  *     relationship);
  *   - [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Many Many]]`[E]` is a derived kin for `Iterable[E]`;
  *   - [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.KinSeq KinSeq]] and [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.KinSet KinSet]]
  *     are `Many` subtypes for `Seq[E]` and `Set[E]` as expected;
  *   - finally, [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.Kin.Of Of]]`[C, E]` is a type alias for `Derived[C[E], E]`, allowing
  *     shorter and cleaner type signatures: `Set Of Swords`.
  *
  * When creating kin for collection types, prefer using the appropriate interface type, rather than one specifying
  * a single, default Scala implementation: `Seq[E]` instead of `List[E]`, `Map[K, E]` instead of `HashMap[K, E]`.
  * This allows loaded kin to use special tracking implementations, allowing optimisations when the kin for the
  * new collection is saved. For the same reason, prefer, where possible, to use the methods of the present collection
  * to create derived collections, rather than creating new collections from scratch and filling them with
  * elements manually.
  *
  * As a kin is immutable (at least in the interface - implementations may use mutable state as long as the client
  * will never see different results for the same call on the `Kin`), it is covariant in regards to the value type -
  * a `Kin[A]` is intuitively a `Kin[B]` for `B >: A`. Their dual nature of value-or-specification-of-a-value has
  * however a hidden contravariant element to it in the latter form: in the most trivial example, a `Kin` specifying
  * 'all instances of the given type' can be interpreted differently when viewed as a `Kin` to a super type - larger
  * set of theoretically possible values. In most cases it won't matter and the set of possible values is constrained
  * externally in an explicit way, but it is something to be aware of.
