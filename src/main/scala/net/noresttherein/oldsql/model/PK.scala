/** A convenient class to use as primary keys. It introduces a distinction between 'persistent' and 'transient'
  * keys, which reflects the state of the identified entity. A persistent key is a key of an entity loaded from
  * the repository (previously assigned) and wraps some kind of a unique value. A transient key is a key created
  * by the application for fresh entities; if the keys for the entity are assigned by the databaase (or repository itself),
  * it is essentially a dummy value using referential equality instead of the equality of the wrapped key: each new
  * instance is unique. This allows to declare the primary key of an entity as a non-null, non-option type ''and''
  * use the key equality to distinguish between entities abstracting over their persistent/transient state.
  * If keys are assigned by the application before storing the value, a transient key wrapping the value of the appropriate
  * type can be used. Such a key will equal also persistent instances of the same value, but still provide a handy
  * distinction between persistent and transient entity, which can in many cases save a round-trip call to the database
  * otherwise needed to verify if the saved entity (in particular, in cascade saves) should be inserted or updated.
  * @tparam T the type of the identified entity.
