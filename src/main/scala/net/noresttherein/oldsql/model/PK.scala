/** A convenient class to use as primary keys. It introduces a distinction between 'persistent' and 'transient'
  * keys, which reflects the state of the identified entity. A persistent key, implemented as the
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.PK.PersistentPK PersistentPK]] subclass, is a key of an entity loaded from
  * the repository (previously assigned) and wraps some kind of a unique value. A transient key
  * ([[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.PK.TransientPK TransientPK]] is a key created by the application
  * for fresh entities. If keys are assigned explicitly by the application before storing the value,
  * a transient key wrapping the value of the appropriate type in the form of
  * [[net.noresttherein.oldsql.model.PK.AssignedPK AssignedPK]] can be used. Such a key will symmetrically equal
  * also persistent instances of the same value, but still provide a useful distinction between persistent and transient
  * entities, which can in many cases save a round-trip call to the database otherwise needed to verify
  * if the entity being saved (in particular, in cascade saves) should be inserted or updated. If the keys
  * are assigned automatically by the database (or the repository after passing it a transient instant),
  * the default transient key implementation should be used as placeholders on new entities before storing.
  * These keys, created by the default factory method of the corresponding companion object, use referential equality.
  * This allows to declare the primary key of an entity as a non-null, non-option type ''and''
  * use the key equality to distinguish between entities abstracting over their persistent/transient state.
  * @tparam T the type of the identified entity. It is purely a marker type used to avoid mistakenly referring to
  *           a wrong entity type by a given key value.
